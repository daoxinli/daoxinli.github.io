Hello! My name is Daoxin Li (李道昕 [lì tɑ̂ʊ̯ ɕín]). I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://linguistics.unc.edu/">Department of Linguistics</a> at the <a href="https://www.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>. 
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
My research focuses on the cognitive and computational mechanisms of language acquisition. Using a combination of theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches, I develop language acquisition models that are both quantitatively explicit and empirically grounded. I also have secondary research interests in theoretical syntax.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Before joining UNC, I received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu">Linguistics</a> from the University of Pennsylvania and was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Northwestern University's <a href="https://childdevelopment.northwestern.edu/">Infant and Child Development Center</a>.
</p>

**Address**: Department of Linguistics, 108 Smith Building, CB#3155, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3155
