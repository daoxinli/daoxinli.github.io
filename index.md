  Hi! My name is Daoxin Li (李道昕 [lì tɑ̂ʊ̯ ɕín]). I am an ABD (all-but-dissertation) PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu">Department of Linguistics</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. I work primarily on syntax and semantics acquisition: I combine theoretical, experimental and computational approaches to develop algorithmic accounts of how children discover the grammar of their language. My advisors are <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ycharles/">Charles Yang</a> and <a href="https://kathrynschuler.com">Kathryn Schuler</a>; and I’m affiliated with <a href="https://www.childlanglab.com/">the Child Language Lab</a>. I also work with <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/trueswell-lab/people/trueswell/">John Trueswell</a> on word learning and with <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~jlegate/">Julie Anne Legate</a> on theoretical syntax. Additionally, I’m part of the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/lcs/">Language and Communication Sciences</a> program at Penn.
