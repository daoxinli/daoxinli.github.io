  Hi! My name is Daoxin Li (李道昕 [lì tɑ̂ʊ̯ ɕín]). I received my PhD in <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu">Linguistics</a> from the University of Pennsylvania in 2024, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ycharles/">Charles Yang</a> and <a href="https://kathrynschuler.com">Katie Schuler</a>; I also worked with <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/trueswell-lab/people/trueswell/">John Trueswell</a> and <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~jlegate/">Julie Legate</a> during my time at Penn.

  My research focuses on the cognitive and computational mechanisms of language acquisition: How do children discover the grammar of their language? Why do children seem to be better at language learning than adults? What is the relation between language acquisition and other cognitive abilities? I combine theoretical, experimental and computational methods to investigate these questions. I also have secondary research interests in theoretical syntax.
