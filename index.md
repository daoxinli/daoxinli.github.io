  Hi! My name is Daoxin Li (李道昕 [lì tɑ̂ʊ̯ ɕín]). I am a fourth-year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu">Department of Linguistics</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. I work primarily on first language acquisition: I combine theoretical, experimental and computational approaches to investigate how children learn the rules in their language. I’m also interested in word learning and theoretical syntax. My advisor is <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ycharles/">Charles Yang</a>; and I’m affiliated with <a href="https://www.childlanglab.com/">the Child Language Lab</a> (PI: <a href="https://kathrynschuler.com">Kathryn Schuler</a>). I’m also part of the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/lcs/">Language and Communication Sciences</a> program at Penn.

  Before coming to Penn, I earned my BA in English Language at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm">Tsinghua University</a>.
