  Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu">the University of Pennsylvania</a>. I work primarily on first language acquisition. I combine theoretical, experimental and quantitative approaches to investigate the mechanisms of language learning. I’m also interested in language processing and theoretical syntax. My advisor is <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ycharles/">Charles Yang</a>; and I’m affiliated with <a href="https://childlanglab.com">the Child Language Lab</a> (PI: <a href="https://kathrynschuler.com">Kathryn Schuler</a>). I’m also part of the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/lcs/">Language and Communication Sciences</a> initiative and the <a href="https://neuroethics.upenn.edu/scan/">Social, Cognitive & Affective Neuroscience </a>program at Penn.
